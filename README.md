# Machine_Learning
Repository for work done for Machine Learning course taken at UT Dallas in the Spring of 2021

## Homework

### Homework 1

This [program](https://github.com/katKINGSLEY/Machine_Learning/blob/main/Homework1/main.cpp) takes an input file called Boston.csv which contains data about the housing market in Boston (also available in sklearn). C++ is used to find the sum, mean, median, range, covariance, and correlation of the data in this file.

### Homework 2

[Homework 2](https://github.com/katKINGSLEY/Machine_Learning/blob/main/Homework2/ML_KLK170230_HW2.Rmd) performs linear regression in R on built in ISLR dataset and evaluates results.

## Projects

### Project 1

This project uses a Titanic survival rate dataset to compare [logistic regression](https://github.com/katKINGSLEY/Machine_Learning/blob/main/Project1/LogisticRegression/) and [Naive Bayes](https://github.com/katKINGSLEY/Machine_Learning/blob/main/Project1/NaiveBayes/) in both C++ and R. While it was a lot more work to implement these algorithms in C++, the runtime was much faster. [Here](https://github.com/katKINGSLEY/Machine_Learning/blob/main/Project1/ML_proj1_essay_KLK170230.pdf) is a paper outlining the full comparison.
