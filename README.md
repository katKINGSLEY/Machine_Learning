## Homework

### Homework 1

This [program](https://github.com/katKINGSLEY/Machine_Learning/blob/main/Homework1/main.cpp) takes an input file called Boston.csv which contains data about the housing market in Boston (also available in sklearn). C++ is used to find the sum, mean, median, range, covariance, and correlation of the data in this file.

### Homework 2

[Homework 2](https://github.com/katKINGSLEY/Machine_Learning/blob/main/Homework2/ML_KLK170230_HW2.Rmd) performs linear regression in R on built in ISLR dataset and evaluates results.
