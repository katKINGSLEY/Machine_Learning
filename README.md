# Machine_Learning
Repository for work done for Machine Learning course taken at UT Dallas in the Spring of 2021

## Assignments

### Assignment 1

This [program](https://github.com/katKINGSLEY/Machine_Learning/blob/main/Assignment1/main.cpp) takes an input file called Boston.csv which contains data about the housing market in Boston (also available in sklearn). C++ is used to find the sum, mean, median, range, covariance, and correlation of the data in this file.

### Assignment 2

The [notebook](https://github.com/katKINGSLEY/Machine_Learning/blob/main/Assignment2/ML_KLK170230_HW2.Rmd) for assignment 2 performs linear regression in R on built in ISLR dataset and evaluates results.

## Projects

### Project 1

A Titanic survival rate dataset is used to compare [logistic regression](https://github.com/katKINGSLEY/Machine_Learning/blob/main/Project1/LogisticRegression/) and [Naive Bayes](https://github.com/katKINGSLEY/Machine_Learning/blob/main/Project1/NaiveBayes/) in both C++ and R. Implementing in R was much simpler than the C++ program, and the runtime was much faster! [Here](https://github.com/katKINGSLEY/Machine_Learning/blob/main/Project1/ML_proj1_essay_KLK170230.pdf) is a paper outlining the full comparison.

### Project 2

Implemented in R, the regression [notebook](https://github.com/katKINGSLEY/Machine_Learning/blob/main/Project2/regression.pdf) uses linear regression, kNN, and decision tree algorithms to determine the price of diamonds. The classification [notebook](https://github.com/katKINGSLEY/Machine_Learning/blob/main/Project2/classification.pdf) uses logistic regression, Naive Bayes, and decision trees - random forest to attempt to classify whether or not a song will be popular or not.
